The dataset containing the question answer pair but same question is repeated in more than one row, so applied group by on answer column to make single row for single question and the answer is clubbed in one
Then all the question and answer is clubbed in one string sequentially, so that there should be a relation between question and answer and a language model can be made and whenever a question is asked it can give a sequential answer.
